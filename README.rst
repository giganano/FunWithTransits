Fun with Transits
=================

|binder| 

This is intended to provide introductory astronomy students with a simple 
interface to play with transit light-curves. If you're an introductory 
astronomy student, click `here`__ to access the module. This will launch the 
*TransitLightCurves.ipynb* ``jupyter notebook`` online, where you can enter 
the parameters of a transit, see the light-curve, and inspect the quality of 
fit to a simple mock data set.
